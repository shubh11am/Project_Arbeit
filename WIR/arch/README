This directory contains all processor architecture-specific components of WIR.


1. DIRECTORY STRUCTURE:
=======================

The current folder contains the following sub-folders:

- arm: Contains WIR components for the ARM processor architecture.

- generic: Contains WIR components for a generic 'MIPS/SPIM' processor
    architecture useful for playing around with WIR.

- leon: Contains WIR components for the Gaisler LEON3 processor architecture.

- patmos: Contains some material for the PATMOS architecture from Denmarks
    Technical University DTU.

- riscv: Contains all WIR components for the open source RISC-V processor
