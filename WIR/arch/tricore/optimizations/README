0. INTRODUCTION:
================

This directory contains WIR-based code optimizations for the Infineon TriCore
processor architectures.


1. DIRECTORY STRUCTURE:
=======================

The current folder contains the following sub-folders:

- constfold: Contains a TriCore-specific constant folding optimization using
    bit-true data and value flow analysis.

- constprop: Contains a TriCore-specific constant propagation optimization using
    bit-true data and value flow analysis.

- deadcode: Contains a TriCore-specific dead code elimination using bit-true
    data and value flow analysis.

- gcregallocation: Contains a TriCore-specific graph coloring-based register
    allocator.

- jumpcorrection: Contains a TriCore-specific jump displacement correction.

- operationbitwidths: Contains a TriCore-specific optimization reducing the bit
    widths of machine operations.

- peephole: Contains some TriCore-specific peephole optimizers.

- predicatedexecution: Contains a Tricore-specific optimization replacing
    conditionally executed arithmetical operations by predicated operations.

- redundantcode: Contains a TriCore-specific optimization that removes redundant
    code from functions using bit-true data and value flow analysis.

- scheduling: Contains a TriCore-specific local instruction scheduler using list
    scheduling.

- siliconbugs: Contains code transformations to work around silicon bugs in the
    TriCore architectures.
